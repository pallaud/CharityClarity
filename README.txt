//Charity Clarity

This web app was developed as part of a group project at the end of a 7 week coding instruction camp through Girls Who Code. The purpose of the application is to present financial information from the websites of national charities in visually appealing formats that allow users to make informed decisions about where to donate money. 
To achieve this, we used a Bootstrap template and the Google Visualization API.

//Files and their purposes
index.html: holds all HTML code. This is the file that must be launched to open the application in a browser.
script.js files: hold all Javascript code. These files implement the Google Visualization API and control visibility of elements on the screen.
